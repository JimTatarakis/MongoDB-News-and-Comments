                        A junior web developer. Currently, I am working on expanding my
                        portfolio and developing my skills. My main sources of energy
                        have been my three kids and energy drinks. Learning from my
                        failures each forgotten quotation, every unclosed function I
                        learn more and more about the technical skills and the ever
                        changing profession of being a web developer.

                    <p>
                        I am working towards becoming a well established full-stack web
                        developer. In the future, I will have a job that not only
                        supports my family, but I will be proud to have. I want to work
                        on projects outside of work as well, showing the community one
                        project at a time what technology can do to help. At heart I
                        love teaching and mentoring, I would like to use that with
                        technology as a method of helping others.
